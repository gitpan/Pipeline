3.11
	+ Pipeline::Analyse was missing. (generally release
	  opensource.fotango.com/svn/trunk/Pipeline to the
          wider world --richardc)

3.10
	+ Applied patches from spurkis@cpan.org re:
		http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=6305

3.09
	+ Added weak references to stop a memory leak when we miss
	  cleaning up the parent of a segment after dispatch -- this
	  is largely thanks to Pierre's work on Data::Structure::Util
	+ started refactoring an awful lot of code in Pipeline to
	  get rid of the mass of the logic that handles the processing
	  of results
	+ Added a Pipeline::Dumper dispatch class

3.08
	+ throws an error if reattach doesn't really work properly (ie,
	  if it gives unexpected results).
	+ fixed a bug that meant end_dispatch was only being called if
	  there was no parent pipeline.  This was a Bad Thing[tm].

3.07
	+ added dispatcher class to the pipeline
	+ added Pipeline::Segment::Async class for asyncronous pipeline
	  segments.
	+ fixed a bug introduced in 3.06 that broke tests relying on
	  Pipeline::Segment::Tester.
	+ Transaction store is flagged at the beginning of a segment
	  dispatch, and the flag is removed at the end of a dispatch.
	+ Fixed a bug that meant the pipeline could not be dispatched twice.

3.06
	+ fixed production returning bug
	+ fixes bug reported by James Fitzgibbon regarding subclassing
	  pipeline stores

3.05
	+ thought of another test, exposed a bug, fixed it

3.04
	+ fixed a bug that was passing on indv. tests but
	  causing tests to fail under a make test.

3.03
	+ Added Error.pm to Makefile.PL

3.02
	+ Added DESTROY to cleanup Transaction store
