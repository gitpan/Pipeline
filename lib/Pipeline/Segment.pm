=head1 NAME

Pipeline::Segment - basic class for a segment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Pipeline::Segment;
  my $ps = Pipeline::Segment->new();
  $ps->dispatch();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Pipeline::Segment> is designed as a part of the C<Pipeline> system.  The
C<Pipeline::Segment> class is designed to be subclassed as a part of the Pipeline
system.  The primary method that needs to be overloaded is the C<dispatch> method,
which the Pipeline class uses to enter each individual segment that it contains.

=head1 METHODS

The C<Pipeline::Segment> class inherits from C<Pipeline::Base> and therefore
also has any additional methods that its superclass may have.

=over 4

=item init()

The C<init> method is called at construction time.  Any arguments passed to the
C<new> method are passed to it.

=item dispatch()

The C<dispatch> method causes the segment to perform its action.

=item dispatch_method()

The C<dispatch_method> gets and sets the method that gets called on dispatch, by
default this is the C<dispatch()> method.

=item cleanup_dispatch()

The C<cleanup_dispatch> method does post-processing on the segment to ensure
no nasty circular references are lying around, as well as disconnecting
various objects that are only useful during a dispatch.

=item store()

The C<store> method gets the current store.

=item parent()

The C<parent> method returns the pipeline that the segment is current operating from.
It is set at dispatch time by the calling pipeline.
